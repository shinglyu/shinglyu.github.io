# Workflow

* Each post go through these folders: `ideas` -> `drafts` -> `human_review`-> `posts`
* `ideas`: raw ideas, usually a voice transcription or high-level bullet points
* `drafts`: fleshed-out drafts, with complete sentences and paragraphs
* `human_review`: posts that are ready for a human editor to review for clarity and style
* `posts`: published posts, ready to be served by Jekyll
* Once the post is moved to `posts`, commit all the relavant ideas/drafts/human_review files deletion in the same commit.
