# Social Media Posts for "My Complete Remote Vibe Coding Setup for Busy Parents"

## LinkedIn / Facebook

I used to think productive coding required hours of uninterrupted focus. Then I became a parent and realized I'd never code again—or so I thought.

As a busy parent, my reality is 5-10 minute bursts between interruptions. Opening my laptop, waiting for my IDE to load, and babysitting an AI agent simply didn't work anymore. I needed something radically different.

Here's what I discovered:

✅ **GitHub Copilot runs entirely in the cloud** - No need to keep my laptop running. The agent works on GitHub's infrastructure while I attend to my child.

✅ **Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys PR previews** - Every code change gets a live preview URL. I can review from my phone without running a local dev server.

✅ **Issue-PR-review workflow is more natural** - Instead of context-switching in VS Code, I just leave inline comments on the exact lines that need fixing. Same workflow as reviewing human PRs.

The result? I can code from my phone during nap time, leave feedback while waiting in line, and make meaningful progress on side projects that would otherwise stall indefinitely.

The full guide shows how to set up GitHub Copilot's agent mode with Cloudflare Pages preview deployments, plus tips on using text-to-speech for quick issue creation and writing custom agent instructions.

As a busy parent with only 5-10 min coding windows, I built a workflow where GitHub Copilot runs entirely in the cloud + Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys PR previews. Now I can code from my phone between interruptions. No laptop needed! 📱💻
