    I'm 呂行 (Shing Lyu), a software architect, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9331-7">author</a>, and speaker who proves concepts work at scale: contributed to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Firefox/Servo</a> reaching hundreds of millions of users, built <a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython">RustPython</a> with tens of thousands of GitHub stars, and years in the trenches as developer, QA engineer, and pre-sales architect helping global enterprises successfully implement AWS, cloud, and Rust technologies where others just make promises - bringing unique East-West perspective from my Taiwan-Netherlands journey.
    <p>I am open to all sorts of collaboration. Feel free to contact me via any channel listed below.</p>
