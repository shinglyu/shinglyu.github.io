In my [previous post]({{site.url}}/blog/2025/07/26/serverless-rust-on-azure-deploying-a-rust-azure-function.html), we deployed a simple "Hello World" Rust function to Azure. Now we're ready to build something production-worthy: a database-backed REST API that handles real business logic. We'll create a cake ordering system for a local bakery, complete with data persistence, input validation, and proper error handling.

<!--more-->

## The Business Case: Sweet API Solutions

Before diving into code, let's establish what we're building. Our fictional bakery needs a digital ordering system where:

- Bakery staff can create custom cake orders taken from counter or phone customers
- Each order tracks customer information, custom text to be printed on the cake, and cake style selections
- Staff can view and manage all orders for fulfillment tracking
- Orders persist in a database for inventory management and operational workflows

Note: We're not implementing user authentication or authorization in this tutorial - that's a topic for future posts. This API is designed for internal bakery operations.

This scenario showcases real-world serverless patterns: event-driven APIs, NoSQL data modeling, input validation, and stateless request handling. It's complex enough to demonstrate production considerations while remaining approachable for learning.

You can find the complete code on GitHub: [https://github.com/shinglyu/serverless-rust-on-azure/tree/api-with-db](https://github.com/shinglyu/serverless-rust-on-azure/tree/api-with-db).

## API Design

## Understanding Azure Functions for Multi-Endpoint APIs

In the previous post, there is only one API endpoint, but for this use case, we need multiple APi endpoints. Before we start coding, let's understand how Azure Functions differs from AWS Lambda in handling multi-endpoint APIs.

### The One-Binary, Multiple-Functions Model

Unlike AWS Lambda where each function is typically a separate deployment unit, Azure Functions with custom handlers works differently:

%%% Insert Microsoft documentation diagrm here
%%% Explain that in the dedicated plan, there is one Function Host in each underlying App Service Plan VM instacne and they talk to one WEb server

Conceptually, you can think of this as: 
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Azure Function App"
        subgraph "Function Host"
            Router[Azure Functions Host Router]
        end
        subgraph "Your Custom Handler"
            Binary[Single Rust Binary/HTTP Server]
        end
        subgraph "Function Definitions"
            F1["/Orders/function.json<br/>POST /api/orders"]
            F2["/Orders_list/function.json<br/>GET /api/orders"]
            F3["/Orders_id/function.json<br/>GET /api/orders/{id}"]
        end
    end
    
    Router --> F1
    Router --> F2 
    Router --> F3
    F1 --> Binary
    F2 --> Binary
    F3 --> Binary
```

**Key insights:**

1. **Shared Code Base**: All your functions' code are in the same binary, and they run as one Warp web server. 
2. **No Function Isolation**: Unlike Lambda's separate execution contexts, your functions share memory and state within the same process.
3. **Configuration-Based Routing**: `function.json` files define HTTP routes and triggers, but your Rust code handles the actual request processing.

This means the "Function" in an Azure Function App are more of a logical construct that has a route and trigger configuration, but not actually separate deployment units. Your custom handler is just a normal web server with multiple routes. So the common web server best practices like using share database connection, extract shared code (e.g. validation, payload formatting) into reusable modules applys here. 

## Database Choice: Azure Cosmos DB (Emulator)

For this tutorial, we'll use Azure Cosmos DB with the local emulator. Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service that fits perfectly with serverless architectures. 

### Why Cosmos DB for Serverless?

**Automatic Scaling**: Cosmos DB scales throughput and storage automatically based on demand, matching the serverless philosophy of paying only for what you use.

**Global Distribution**: Built-in multi-region replication with configurable consistency levels, ideal for global serverless applications.

**Multiple APIs**: Support for NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Gremlin APIs, giving you flexibility in data modeling.

**Serverless Pricing**: Request unit (RU) based billing.

### Local Development Setup

For this tutorial, we'll focus entirely on local development using the Cosmos DB emulator. This approach lets us:
- Develop without Azure account costs
- Work offline and experiment with quick iterations
- Test database scenarios without cloud connectivity issues

*Cloud deployment and production configuration will be covered in the next post in this series.*

## Building the Data Layer

Let's start by defining our domain model and database integration. Our cake ordering system needs to handle orders with customer information, cake specifications, and scheduling.

### Dependencies Setup

First, update your `Cargo.toml` to include the necessary dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
azure_data_cosmos = { version = "0.25.0", features = ["key_auth"] }
azure_core = "0.26.0"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
warp = "0.3"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
uuid = "1.17.0"
chrono = { version = "0.4.41", features = ["serde"] }
reqwest = "0.12.22"  # For testing
futures-util = "0.3.31"
```

The key additions are:
- `azure_data_cosmos`: Official Azure Cosmos DB SDK for Rust
- `uuid`: For generating unique order IDs
- `chrono`: For handling dates and timestamps with proper serialization

### Data Model Design
%%% Maybe split this section and mention these data models when we actually use them in the API

Our order system uses two main structures:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Order {
    #[serde(rename = "id")]
    pub id: String,
    #[serde(rename = "customerId")]
    pub customer_id: String,
    #[serde(rename = "customText")]
    pub custom_text: String,
    #[serde(rename = "cakeStyle")]
    pub cake_style: String,
    pub status: String,
    #[serde(rename = "createdAt", with = "chrono::serde::ts_seconds")]
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    #[serde(rename = "pickupDate", with = "chrono::serde::ts_seconds")]
    pub pickup_date: DateTime<Utc>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CreateOrderRequest {
    #[serde(rename = "customerId")]
    pub customer_id: String,
    #[serde(rename = "customText")]
    pub custom_text: String,
    #[serde(rename = "cakeStyle")]
    pub cake_style: String,
    #[serde(rename = "pickupDate", with = "chrono::serde::ts_seconds")]
    pub pickup_date: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```
The Order struct maps to the CosmosDB "schema" (although it's technically schemaless), and the CreateOrderRequest is used as the input format for the POST /api/orders endpoint.


**Design decisions explained:**

1. **Serde Renaming**: The `#[serde(rename = "...")]` attributes ensure our Rust snake_case fields map to camelCase JSON, following JavaScript conventions for API consistency.

2. **Timestamp Handling**: Using `chrono::serde::ts_seconds` converts between Rust's `DateTime<Utc>` and Unix timestamp integers in JSON.

3. **Separate Request/Response Types**: `CreateOrderRequest` doesn't include generated fields like `id`, `status`, or `created_at`, enforcing proper API boundaries.

%%% Mention how to setup CosmoDB emulator on a high level using Linux + Docker (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-develop-emulator?tabs=docker-linux%2Ccsharp&pivots=api-nosql), don't go into line by line but mention the user can reference the documentation.
<!--PROGRESS MARKER-->
### Database Connection Setup

Setting up the Cosmos DB connection requires handling authentication and client initialization:

```rust
use azure_data_cosmos::CosmosClient;
use azure_data_cosmos::clients::ContainerClient;
use azure_core::credentials::Secret;
use std::sync::Arc;

const COSMOS_EMULATOR_URI: &str = "https://localhost:8081";
const COSMOS_DB_NAME: &str = "CakeDB";
const COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME: &str = "Orders";

// Create shared Cosmos DB container client
let cosmos_key = env::var("COSMOS_EMULATOR_KEY").expect("COSMOS_EMULATOR_KEY required");
let client = CosmosClient::with_key(COSMOS_EMULATOR_URI, Secret::from(cosmos_key), None)
    .expect("Failed to create Cosmos client");
let database_client = client.database_client(COSMOS_DB_NAME);
let container_client = Arc::new(database_client.container_client(COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME));
```

**Key architectural choices:**

- **Arc Wrapping**: We wrap the `ContainerClient` in `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) to safely share the database connection across multiple request handlers.
- **Environment Variables**: Database credentials come from environment variables, following twelve-factor app principles.
- **Error Handling**: Using `expect()` for setup failures ensures the application fails fast if misconfigured.

## Warp Framework Fundamentals

Warp is a lightweight, composable web framework that fits perfectly with Azure Functions' custom handler model. Unlike traditional MVC frameworks, Warp uses a filter-based approach that's both powerful and performant.

### Why Warp?

**Filter Composition**: Build complex routing logic by combining simple, reusable filters.
**Async-First Design**: Built from the ground up for async/await, with excellent performance characteristics.
**Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees for request parsing and response generation.
**Minimal Overhead**: Low resource usage, crucial for serverless cold starts.

### Core Concepts

Warp organizes request handling around three main concepts:

1. **Filters**: Functions that either accept or reject requests, potentially extracting data
2. **Handlers**: Async functions that process accepted requests and generate responses
3. **Replies**: Type-safe response builders for HTTP responses

Here's how they work together:

```rust
use warp::Filter;

// Filter: Extract JSON body and validate it
let json_body = warp::body::json::<CreateOrderRequest>();

// Filter: Inject shared database client
let database_filter = warp::any().map({
    let container_client = Arc::clone(&container_client);
    move || Arc::clone(&container_client)
});

// Combined filter + handler
let create_order = warp::post()
    .and(warp::path("api"))
    .and(warp::path("orders"))
    .and(json_body)
    .and(database_filter)
    .and_then(create_order_handler);
```

This filter composition makes it easy to share validation logic, database connections, and error handling across multiple endpoints.

## Implementing RESTful Endpoints

Let's build our three main endpoints progressively, starting with order creation and building up to the complete CRUD API.

### POST /api/orders - Creating Orders

The order creation endpoint demonstrates input validation, business logic, and database interaction:

```rust
use warp::reply::json;
use std::convert::Infallible;

async fn create_order_handler(
    req: CreateOrderRequest,
    container_client: Arc<ContainerClient>
) -> Result<impl warp::Reply, Infallible> {
    // Validation logic here (covered in next section)
    
    // Generate order ID and timestamp
    let order_id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    let now = Utc::now();
    
    let order = Order {
        id: order_id.clone(),
        customer_id: req.customer_id.clone(),
        custom_text: req.custom_text.clone(),
        cake_style: req.cake_style.clone(),
        status: "pending".to_string(),
        created_at: now,
        pickup_date: req.pickup_date,
    };

    // Store in Cosmos DB
    let partition_key = azure_data_cosmos::PartitionKey::from(order.customer_id.clone());
    let result = container_client.upsert_item(partition_key, order.clone(), None).await;

    match result {
        Ok(_) => Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
            json(&order),
            warp::http::StatusCode::OK,
        )),
        Err(e) => Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
            json(&serde_json::json!({"error": format!("DB error: {:?}", e)})),
            warp::http::StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
        )),
    }
}
```

**Key implementation details:**

- **Partition Key Strategy**: Using `customer_id` as the partition key distributes orders across multiple physical partitions for better performance.
- **Upsert vs Insert**: Using `upsert_item()` instead of `create_item()` handles potential duplicate requests gracefully.
- **Error Conversion**: The `Infallible` return type means our handler never panics, converting all errors to proper HTTP responses.

### GET /api/orders - Listing All Orders

The list endpoint demonstrates query execution and result aggregation:

```rust
async fn get_orders_handler(
    container_client: Arc<ContainerClient>
) -> Result<impl warp::Reply, Infallible> {
    let query = azure_data_cosmos::Query::from("SELECT * FROM c");
    let mut pager = container_client
        .query_items::<Order>(query, (), None)
        .unwrap();

    let mut orders = Vec::new();
    while let Some(page) = pager.next().await {
        let page = page.unwrap();
        orders.push(page);
    }

    Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
        json(&orders),
        warp::http::StatusCode::OK,
    ))
}
```

This implementation uses Cosmos DB's SQL-like query syntax to retrieve all orders. The paged result handling ensures we collect all orders regardless of result set size.

### GET /api/orders/{id} - Single Order Retrieval

The single order endpoint shows parameterized queries and proper error handling:

```rust
async fn get_order_handler(
    id: String,
    container_client: Arc<ContainerClient>
) -> Result<impl warp::Reply, Infallible> {
    // Validation first
    if !is_valid_uuid(&id) {
        return Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
            json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "Invalid order ID format"})),
            warp::http::StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
        ));
    }

    // Secure parameterized query
    let query = azure_data_cosmos::Query::from("SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = @id")
        .with_parameter("@id", &id)
        .map_err(|_| {
            warp::reply::with_status(
                json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "Query parameter error"})),
                warp::http::StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            )
        })?;

    // Execute query and handle results
    let mut pager = container_client.query_items::<Order>(query, (), None).unwrap();
    
    let mut found: Option<Order> = None;
    while let Some(page) = pager.next().await {
        let page = page.unwrap();
        found = Some(page);
        break;
    }

    match found {
        Some(order) => Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
            json(&order),
            warp::http::StatusCode::OK,
        )),
        None => Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
            json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "Order not found"})),
            warp::http::StatusCode::NOT_FOUND,
        )),
    }
}
```

## Input Validation & Security

Production APIs require robust input validation and security measures. Our cake ordering system implements multiple validation layers to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

### Validation Strategy

We implement validation at three levels:
1. **Type-level validation**: Rust's type system prevents basic errors
2. **Format validation**: Check data formats (UUIDs, ASCII text, length limits)
3. **Business rule validation**: Enforce domain-specific constraints

### Validation Implementation

```rust
use uuid::Uuid;

// Hardcoded cake styles for business validation
const CAKE_STYLES: &[&str] = &[
    "vanilla-flowers",
    "chocolate-hearts", 
    "strawberry-rainbow",
    "vanilla-classic",
];

// Format validation helpers
fn is_valid_uuid(id: &str) -> bool {
    Uuid::parse_str(id).is_ok()
}

fn is_ascii_and_short(text: &str) -> bool {
    text.is_ascii() && text.len() <= 50
}

fn is_valid_cake_style(style: &str) -> bool {
    CAKE_STYLES.contains(&style)
}
```

### Applying Validation in Handlers

The validation functions integrate directly into our endpoint handlers:

```rust
// In create_order_handler:
if !is_valid_uuid(&req.customer_id) {
    return Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
        json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "Invalid customerId UUID"})),
        warp::http::StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
    ));
}

if !is_ascii_and_short(&req.custom_text) {
    return Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
        json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "customText must be ASCII and ≤50 chars"})),
        warp::http::StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
    ));
}

if !is_valid_cake_style(&req.cake_style) {
    return Ok(warp::reply::with_status(
        json(&serde_json::json!({"error": "Invalid cakeStyle"})),
        warp::http::StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
    ));
}
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **Fail Fast**: Invalid requests are rejected immediately with clear error messages
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each validation function has a single responsibility
- **Reusable Logic**: Validation functions can be shared across endpoints and tested independently

### Security: Parameterized Queries

One of the most critical security measures is preventing SQL injection attacks. Even though Cosmos DB uses a SQL-like syntax, it's still vulnerable to injection if queries are constructed incorrectly.

**Wrong approach (vulnerable to injection):**
```rust
// DON'T DO THIS - Vulnerable to injection
let query = format!("SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = '{}'", user_input);
```

**Correct approach (secure with parameters):**
```rust
// DO THIS - Safe parameterized query
let query = azure_data_cosmos::Query::from("SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = @id")
    .with_parameter("@id", &id)?;
```

The `.with_parameter()` method properly escapes and validates the input, making injection attacks impossible.

## Shared State Management

One of the biggest advantages of Azure Functions' custom handler model is the ability to share expensive resources across multiple requests. Database connections are prime candidates for this optimization.

### The Connection Pooling Challenge

Creating new database connections for every request is expensive:
- Network handshake overhead
- Authentication processing
- Connection establishment latency
- Resource cleanup costs

In a serverless environment where you pay for execution time, these costs add up quickly.

### Arc-based Shared State

Rust's `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) type provides a safe way to share data across async tasks:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create the shared client once at startup
let container_client = Arc::new(database_client.container_client(COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME));

// Warp filter to inject the shared client into handlers
let database_filter = warp::any().map({
    let container_client = Arc::clone(&container_client);
    move || Arc::clone(&container_client)
});
```

**How this works:**
1. **Single Connection**: One `ContainerClient` is created at application startup
2. **Reference Counting**: `Arc::clone()` creates additional references without copying the actual client
3. **Thread Safety**: `Arc` ensures the client can be safely shared across async tasks
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When the last reference is dropped, the connection is automatically closed

### Warp Filter Integration

Warp's filter system makes dependency injection elegant and type-safe:

```rust
let create_order = warp::post()
    .and(warp::path("api"))
    .and(warp::path("orders"))
    .and(warp::body::json())
    .and(database_filter.clone())  // Inject the shared client
    .and_then(create_order_handler);

let get_orders = warp::get()
    .and(warp::path("api"))
    .and(warp::path("orders"))
    .and(warp::path::end())
    .and(database_filter.clone())  // Same client, different endpoint
    .and_then(get_orders_handler);
```

The `database_filter.clone()` creates a new filter that injects the same shared client into different handlers. This pattern scales to any number of endpoints without additional overhead.

### Performance Benefits

This shared state approach provides significant performance improvements:
- **Reduced Cold Start Time**: Connection established once, not per request
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Single connection pool instead of per-request connections
- **Better Throughput**: Eliminated connection establishment overhead
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced execution time directly translates to lower serverless costs

## Testing the API

Testing database-backed APIs requires a different approach than testing pure functions. We need to verify both the HTTP interface and the database interactions work correctly.

### Local Testing Setup

First, ensure you have the Cosmos DB emulator running and configure your environment:

```bash
# Set up local.settings.json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "custom",
    "COSMOS_EMULATOR_KEY": "your-cosmos-emulator-key-here"
  }
}
```

Start your function locally:
```bash
func start
```

### Manual Testing with curl

Test the complete order lifecycle:

```bash
# Create a new order
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7071/api/orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "customText": "Happy Birthday Sarah!",
    "cakeStyle": "vanilla-flowers",
    "pickupDate": 1735689600
  }'

# List all orders
curl "http://localhost:7071/api/orders"

# Get specific order (use ID from create response)
curl "http://localhost:7071/api/orders/[order-id-here]"
```

### Integration Testing with Rust

For automated testing, we can use the `reqwest` crate to test our API:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use reqwest;
    use serde_json::json;

    const BASE_URL: &str = "http://localhost:7071/api/orders";

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_create_and_retrieve_order() {
        let client = reqwest::Client::new();
        
        // Create order
        let create_payload = json!({
            "customerId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
            "customText": "Test order",
            "cakeStyle": "vanilla-flowers",
            "pickupDate": 1735689600
        });

        let response = client
            .post(BASE_URL)
            .json(&create_payload)
            .send()
            .await
            .unwrap();
            
        assert!(response.status().is_success());
        
        let order: Order = response.json().await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(order.custom_text, "Test order");
        
        // Retrieve the created order
        let get_response = client
            .get(&format!("{}/{}", BASE_URL, order.id))
            .send()
            .await
            .unwrap();
            
        assert!(get_response.status().is_success());
        
        let retrieved_order: Order = get_response.json().await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(retrieved_order.id, order.id);
    }
}
```

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --test api_integration
```

**Testing best practices:**
- **Test Real Scenarios**: Use actual HTTP requests, not just unit tests
- **Clean State**: Consider database cleanup between tests
- **Error Cases**: Test validation failures and edge cases
- **Performance**: Monitor response times and resource usage

## Building and Deployment

The deployment process builds on what we established in the previous tutorial, with some additional considerations for database-backed applications.

### Local Development Configuration

Create your `local.settings.json` based on the example:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "custom",
    "COSMOS_EMULATOR_KEY": "C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw=="
  }
}
```

*Note: The key shown above is the default Cosmos DB emulator key, safe for local development.*

### Build Process

The build process remains the same as our previous tutorial:

```bash
# Build for Linux deployment
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/handler .
```

### Function Configuration

Each endpoint requires its own function definition. Create the following folder structure:

```
Orders/
  function.json
Orders_list/
  function.json  
Orders_id/
  function.json
```

Example `Orders/function.json` for the POST endpoint:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["post"],
      "route": "orders"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Azure Functions to route POST requests to `/api/orders` to your custom handler.

## What's Next?
