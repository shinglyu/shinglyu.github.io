* The problem => Waste time on fb

I always find myself mindlessly browsing Facebook or Feedly (RSS reader) for way too long. Although I know there is nothing new on Facebook, I still can't fight the temptation of a Dopamine surge, which results in reduced productivity. If you've read the book _[The Willpower Instinct_](TBD), you'll know that the willpower is like a muscle, even trivial decisions like resisting to check Facebook will deplete the strength of your willpower "muscle", which eventually makes you give in to the temptation or something much worse, like skip exercise or break your diet, because you'll willpower was worn done. One way to prevent this is to reduce the exposure to potential cues. When you subconsciously open Facebook, it's super likely that you'll be attracted by the posts and photos, and starts to drift away from your "flow". But if Facebook is blocked, you'll probably shrug and get back to work.


I've tried various schedule-based blocking solutions, like [LeechBlock](TBD) and GNOME [Nanny](TBD). But the problem with schedule-based method is that it's not flexible enough. My preferred schedule is roughly like: open for 10 minutes, then block for the next 50 minutes. Setting up this kind of schedule is way too much work. And if you finish your big chunk of work at, say 10:45, but your open time slot is 11:00 to 11:10, then you can't "borrow" the 10 minutes from future time slots.

My solution to this is to use a more flexible scheme: When you first open a page in your blacklist, we start a timer for 10 minutes; when the time is up, we'll start blocking for 50 minutes. After the 50 minutes blocking period, we'll unblock all the website, but the countdown timer won't start until you open any website that's on your blacklist. This gives you maximum flexibility to relax and check facebook for 10 minutes, then get back to work for at least 50 minutes. If you're in the flow and work for more the 50 minutes, we'll always reserve the 10 minutes allowence when you really want to use it. And if you want to start working (and blocking) right away, we have a button for that.

This method works pretty well for me, it helped me finish my master thesis and be productive at work. It works for other people too, there are over 1000 active users for the [Firefox version](). I recieved many positive comments, suggestions, and even donations from the Firefox community. For example:

I'm really grateful for all the donations and suggestions. Thank you all!

As for the future direction of FocusBlocker


* Theory => The willpower instinct.
* Why the old method doesn't work => total block, can't search; Timed, too unflexable
* Our solution => Start counting when you open it
* WebExtension migration
* Future directions
  * Better add blacklist UI
  * Add blacklist button
  * WebExtension
* Call to action => Download, visual design
