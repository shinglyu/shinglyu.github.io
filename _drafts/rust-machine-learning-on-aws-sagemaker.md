1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of Rust and its benefits for machine learning
    - Fast for CPU models and has good GPU library support
    - Faster feedback cycle, so you don't run a model for days and hit a runtime bug (give example)
   - Introduction to AWS SageMaker and its capabilities
   - List some popular Rust ML frameworks: Linfa, Smartcore, Candle, Burn

3. **Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) in SageMaker**
   - Overview of BYOC in SageMaker
   - Benefits of using custom containers
   - Prerequisites (AWS CLI, Docker, etc.)

4. **The Container Structure**
   - Exploring the directory structure for the custom container
   - Understanding the required files and folders
    - train and serve binary

5. **Rust Binary Folder Structure**
   - Setting up the Rust project directory
   - Organizing source code, dependencies, and build artifacts

6. **Dockerfile**
   - Writing the Dockerfile for the custom container
   - Specifying the base image, dependencies, and build steps
   - Copying the Rust binary and other necessary files

7. **Makefile**
   - Creating a Makefile for build automation
   - Targets for building the Rust binary
   - Targets for building and pushing the Docker image

8. **Pushing to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
   - Setting up an ECR repository
   - Authenticating with ECR
   - Pushing the custom container image to ECR

9. **Notebook for Training and Deployment**
   - Why Python notebook instead of Rust notebook: higher level syntax with SageMaker SDK
   - Creating a SageMaker notebook instance
   - Importing necessary libraries and dependencies
   - Loading and preprocessing data
   - Defining the training job configuration
   - Launching the training job with the custom container
   - Deploying the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint

10. **Making Inference Calls**
    - Sending inference requests to the deployed SageMaker endpoint
    - Handling the inference responses
    - Best practices for inference in production environments

11. **Monitoring and Debugging**
    - Monitoring training jobs and endpoints with CloudWatch
    - Debugging techniques for Rust ML applications on SageMaker
    - Logging and profiling strategies
    - Future work: metrics

12. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of key points
    - Potential use cases and future improvements
    - Additional resources for learning Rust and SageMaker
