I would like to acknowledge the contribution of my co-author, Andrew Rzeznik, who took over the project after I had to stop for personal circumstances. He did a fantastic job in finishing the book and making it even better than I could have imagined. I am very happy with the final outcome of our collaboration, and I hope you will find our book useful and enjoyable. Thank you, Andrew Rzeznik, for your hard work and dedication!

Although this book is called the 2nd edition, it actually combines the content from my two previous books, [Practical Rust Projects (1st edition)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5599-5) and [Practical Rust Web Projects](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6589-5), both published by Apress. The book grows from 265 pages in the 1st edition to 396 pages in the 2nd! By having all the topics in one place, you can learn Rust more holistically and see how it can solve different problems in different domains. This book is suitable for anyone who has some basic knowledge of Rust and wants to apply it in real-world scenarios. Whether you are a hobbyist, a student, or a professional developer, you will find something interesting and useful in this book.

If you are interested in buying this book, you can find it at various sources, such as:
